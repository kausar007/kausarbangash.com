Download WinMD5Free using this [link](http://winmd5.com/).
Extract the zip file and run WinMD5Free.exe
Browse and select the file. WinMD5Free will compute the MD5 checksum and display it.
You can also paste MD5 value given on the website for the file you want to check MD5 for and then click on verify to verify if both the checksums match.
